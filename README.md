# Scan Documents (RAG)

A comprehensive document scanning and management solution that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance document retrieval and processing capabilities. This repository is designed to facilitate efficient document digitization, storage, and intelligent retrieval using state-of-the-art AI techniques including RAGs, and LLM.

## Features

- Document Scanning: Capture high-quality scans of physical documents with minimal setup.
- RAG Integration: Employs RAG to provide intelligent and context-aware document search.
- Multi-format Support: Supports PDF, JPEG, PNG, and other common document formats.
- Easy Integration: Can be seamlessly integrated with other applications for extended functionality.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
To get started, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/javaidiqbal11/scan-documents-RAG.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd scan-documents-RAG
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

1. Start the application by running:
